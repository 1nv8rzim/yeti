# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally push security fixes on the latest versions of Yeti (`:latest`
Docker tag). Depending on when it was introduced, and If the security is deemed
critical, we will backport it to previous versions.

If you, as a production user of Yeti, are not comfortable with this and the
below conditions, then we discourage usage of the platform in production.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the process at https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/security to
report new security vulnerabilities.

## Timeline expectations

This is a community-driven project, and our community is quite small. So please
expect updates and progress to happen on a best-effort basis, especially if the
vulnerability is not critical. We appreciate that you might want to publish
details about the vulnerability, but we please ask that **you give us at least 45
days to work on a fix _once we've acknowledged_ your report**.

## Credit & rewards

You'll get credit for reporting vulnerabilities to us and helping us fix them,
but please don't expect any other rewards besides our gratitude, a shout-out on
social media, and potentially some stickers :)
